# Geometry-Escape

Another iPhone game I made in highschool. This one actually got published to the app store.

Probably the best way to explain this game, is for me not to explain it at all and instead just watch the video: "AppTutorial.mp4" (https://github.com/lee-warren/Geometry-Escape/blob/master/App%20Tutorial.mp4)
This was the last game I published to the app store so it would be the most advance of them, except for maybe the 500 scoring app.
Still highschool level, so I doubt it will hold up at all.
